What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
--I was having problems with knowing which directory I sohuld be making commands in the terminal, navigating between branches and push to github protocol

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
--All of the above.  It was very helpful to talk through the steps with Julian 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
--I asked how Julian he best remembers what branch to work with and when, and inquired about other resources he used this week.  

What still confuses you about Git?
I'm still working out the commit and push workflow, and expereienced some confusion with the fetch and merge during the GPS.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was my first GPS and my first pairing.  I thought it was great. Helene -sp?- was very nice and helpful, stepping in when we were headed down the wrong path but giving us a good amount of leadway before she did. Also, her explanations were candid and provided good direction.  Julian was great to work with, he really helped the process keep moving, communicated very clearly and timely, and gave considerate and actionable feedback.
