	- I had never dealt with a merge conflict before this challenge. I was still unsure of how to resolve it in practice. 

2 What concepts were clarified during the GPS? 

	- The conflict merge concept was clarified, along with creating a repository fresh from start and having more than 1 contributor working on it. 

	- Lucas and I also digressed on why committing is important and why working on branches is important in a repository with multiple contributors. 

3 What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? 

	-I asked whether one should commit an empty file that was only created
	-The guide also clarifyed that it is not necessary to merge locally if we are using  GitHub repository
